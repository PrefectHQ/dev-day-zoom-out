# The Summit Dev Day repo

This is the repository for Summit Dev Day January 2025.

## Setup

Use your chosen Python virtual environment manager.
We suggest using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) because it's fast and relatively quick to set up, but feel free to use your preferred tool.
The examples below show uv.

### Download the repository and navigate to the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrefectHQ/dev-day-zoom-out.git
cd dev-day-zoom-out
```

### Install uv (if needed)

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # TK maybe use homebrew instead. Jeremiah might have found an issue.
```

For Windows:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For troubleshooting, see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).

### Create and activate a new virtual environment

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.12.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

You should see a note that the virtual environment was created successfully and instructions for how to activate it. Follow the instructions to activate the virtual environment.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see the virtual environment name in parentheses in your terminal prompt .

### Install Prefect and the other Python packages you'll use during Dev Day

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Connect to Prefect Cloud

If you don't already have a Prefect Cloud account, sign up for a free account at [app.prefect.cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud).

If your command line is not already authenticated with Prefect Cloud, authenticate with

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

If you have any issues connecting to Prefect Cloud, see the [Connect to Prefect Cloud docs](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/manage/cloud/connect-to-cloud).

Alternatively, you can use a self-hosted Prefect server instance for the first part of Dev Day. See the [instructions for self-hosting a Prefect server](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/manage/self-host).
