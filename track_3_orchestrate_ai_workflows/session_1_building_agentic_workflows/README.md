# Session 1: Building Agentic Workflows

`slackbot/` contains the entire implementation of a relatively simple Slackbot powered by [`pydantic-ai`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) and [`prefect`](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).

See the [README](slackbot/README.md) for more details on how to try it out.
